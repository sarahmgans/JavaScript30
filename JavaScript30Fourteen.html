    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2)// Wes, Wes
    name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(name, name2)// Wesley, Wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team is just a reference to the original array, when you update it goes back to the reference.

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[3] = 'gans';
    console.log(team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players) 

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99 // mutates the origin array

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    console.log(cap3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: wes,
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos@developer'
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assing({}, wes)
    dev.name = 'Wesley';
    // does not affect origin 
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'
    // this does affect the origin 

    // deep clone without library
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.strigify(wes))
    // JSON.stringify returns string, then you parse it to put it into an object, then you get full copy of object.
